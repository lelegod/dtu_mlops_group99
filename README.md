The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of an individual tennis point by estimating the probability that the server wins the point. Tennis is a point-by-point sport, where each point depends on a small number of clear factors. This makes it a good fit for probabilistic modeling. Instead of trying to predict entire matches, which involve many layered and unpredictable dynamics, this project will look at the game at a single point. Each point is treated as an independent observation, and predictions are made using only information available at the moment the point begins. This allows the problem to be formulated as an independent and identically distributed supervised learning task, without relying on sequential or time-series modeling assumptions.

The project will be implemented using XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) as the base framework, with the modeling pipeline structured to ensure reproducibility and clear separation between data processing, feature construction, training, and evaluation. Raw point-by-point tennis data is represented in tabular form in which each row corresponds to a single point. Features consist of pre-point variables such as player ranking differences, surface type, serve number (first or second serve), and score context. These features capture player strength, environmental conditions, and pressure situations while avoiding the use of any information derived from previous or future points.

The primary data source for the project will be the publicly available Jeff Sackmann tennis point-by-point datasets (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_slam_pointbypoint), which include detailed records of professional ATP and Grand Slam matches. Each data sample includes the point winner and all relevant contextual variables required to define the input features. Only information known at the start of the point will be used in order to avoid data leakage and preserve a clean modeling setup.

The model used in the project will be a gradient boosted decision tree model, probably XGBoost. Gradient boosting is well suited for this task because it can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features while remaining effective on structured tabular data. The model will output calibrated probabilities for point outcomes, and its performance will be evaluated using probability-based metrics, with particular emphasis on predictive reliability rather than simple accuracy.
